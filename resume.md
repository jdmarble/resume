### Skills {#skills}

* Air Gap Cluster Design
  : Engineers systems of computers and their workloads for no-touch, disconnected environments.

  Kickstart/Anaconda, systemd, RHEL, CoreOS, PXE, and iPXE.

* Microservice Architecture
  : Designs, develops, and deploys containerized Java and Python services along with the infrastructure that they run and communicate on.

* Continuous Integration and Deployment
  : Transforms manual software delivery into automated, reliable, and safe processes. Extends the benefits of CI/CD beyond application software to operating system and container orchestrator configuration.

  Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, and Bamboo. 

* Kubernetes
  : My kid's Minecraft server, my home lab, and my sprinklers run on Kubernetes. I also manage some clusters at work too.

  Flux, Argo CD, and kapp-controller for continuous delivery. Packaging applications using Helm, Kustomize, and ytt. Deploying clusters using k3s, EKS, TKG and The Hard Way.
